      <h3>Anarchy Online</h3>
      <p>Anarchy Online is a sci-fi mmorpg that was released in 2001. This game was my first mmorpg, and I loved it; even have an OT tattoo. My main character was a gun wielding doctor. I made quite a few friends in that game, ran an org at one point, and later was in one of the best raiding Omni-Tek organizations on the server. There were lots of late night raids, and lots of solo exploring, as that was what I liked to do. The best thing that happened in that game was meeting my future husband. Amazingly, Anarchy Online is still around, though it has changed (not really for the better, either). I don't play it anymore, but it will always hold a place in my heart. </p>

      <h3>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</h3>
      <p>Back when I had an old, original Xbox, one of the first games I ever played all the way through was Morrowind. It was the first RPG I ever completed, and was the reason I grew to love the genre. The music is fantastic, and the graphics were great for the time. There was so much to do, and I loved the open world in the game. This will always be a game I love. </p>

    <div id="Sims3" class="tabcontent">
      <img class="card-img-top" src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/47890/ss_3a0473385de08d63bd41a74bdd1f6295464f5b85.600x338.jpg?t=1447353867" alt="The Sims 3"><p>
      <h3>The Sims 3</h3>
      <p>The Sims 3 is like the ultimate life simulation game for escaping real life. The amount of expansions available to add on to that experience is insane. While I don't own all of the expansions, I own several. And I do own Sims 4, but Sims 3 is better, by a lot, in my opinion anyways. If I had to pick only one expansion as a favorite, it would be the Supernatural expansion. Since having that expansion, I never play as just a human anymore. I still play this from time to time when I need an escape or when life is getting too hectic. </p>

        <div id ="WoW" class="tabcontent">
          <img class="card-img-top" src="http://pwncastdailyquest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wow_6-0_garrison_alliance_ad_01_tga_jpgcopy.jpg" alt="World of Warcraft"><p>
          <h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
          <p>While I have played and tried out multiple mmorpgs, World of Warcraft is my favorite that is still relative. My main on there was a Troll Shaman with Restro as main spec, Elemental as secondary spec. I mostly played as Horde, even though I started out as Alliance. I still find the Alliance asthetics to be much prettier. My favorite thing to do was venture out on my own. WoW has such a giant world and so many things that can be done solo as an end game player, so I went on adventures. I haven't played WoW in a while, and I do miss it at times. However, it is a very consuming game, and I don't really have time for it. Maybe one day I'll return to Azeroth.</p>

          <h3>The Guild II: Renaissance</h3>
          <p>The Guild II: Renaissance is a RTS game with a Renaissance theme where one of the main goals is to own buildings, make money, and work your way up. This has been one of my favorite games to play in 2017. Aside from it being a RTS, there is a bit of an RPG element to it as well since you have to marry off your player, build a life, have children, and carry on your bloodline. It is an awesome game all around.</p>

          <h3>Roller Coaster Tycoon 3: Platinum</h3>
          <p>Good ol' Roller Coaster Tycoon! The original was one of the first PC games I played as a kid, and even years later, it is still a fun game. The version I have currently is 3, platinum edition. It's one of those games where I may play it if I want to play a game, but don't want to be immersed heavily into a story line and want something fun and super casual. </p>

        <div id="Civ5" class="tabcontent">
          <img class="card-img-top" src="http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/8930/ss_84ee7ab3b0148a260359f8d5a78a2ab9033aa695.600x338.jpg?t=1490021806" alt="Civilzation V"><p>
          <h3>Civilzation V</h3>
          <p>Civ V is hands-down the best turn-based strategy game in existence. This is the game that really made me realize that I love strategy games. The game is even better if you have all of the extra content (which goes on sale somewhat regularly on Steam). It's one of those games where you think you may just play for a couple of hours, next thing you know, you're conquering other lands and it's the next day. And as always, one more turn!</p>
